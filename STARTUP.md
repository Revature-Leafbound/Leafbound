# Leafbound Startup

Github Repository: [Leafbound](https://github.com/Revature-Leafbound/Leafbound)

## 1. Cloning the repository

Using the terminal, navigate to the location that you would like to place your project.

_The next command will create a sub-folder named leafbound; therefore you do not need to create the project folder._

Run `git clone https://github.com/Revature-Leafbound/Leafbound`

Run `cd leafbound`

Run `npm install`

## 2. Starting the Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server.

In your favorite browser, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

_The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files._

You should also clone the Leafbound-API Repsoitory for back-end support.
